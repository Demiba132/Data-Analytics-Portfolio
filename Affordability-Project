## Business Problem
Most living-wage and affordability tools rely on **state or national averages**, which often hide large cost-of-living differences between cities within the same state. This limits their usefulness for individuals, families, employers, and policymakers who need more localized insight.

The goal of this project was to analyze **how affordable different U.S. cities are for different household types**, using a framework that balances realism, transparency, and data availability. Rather than modeling every possible expense, the focus was on building a defensible, explainable approach that supports comparison and decision-making.

The final deliverable is an interactive tool that allows users to compare their household income against estimated living costs at the **city level**, instead of relying on broad averages.

## Business Context & Stakeholders
This analysis is relevant for:
- Individuals and families evaluating relocation options
- Employers and HR teams considering geographic pay differences
- Policymakers and planners assessing affordability patterns
- Analysts seeking to understand regional cost-of-living tradeoffs

The project prioritizes **clarity, transparency, and explainability**, ensuring that assumptions and limitations are easy to understand and communicate.

## Data Sources & Rationale
Two primary data sources were used, each selected for a specific reason:

### MIT Living Wage Calculator
- Provides standardized estimates of essential living costs
- Used at the **state level**, since non-housing expenses (food, healthcare, transportation, childcare, taxes) tend to vary more by state than by individual city

### U.S. Census API
- Used to retrieve **city-level housing price data**
- Housing costs were modeled at the city level due to their high variability within states

This hybrid approach reflects a practical analytical tradeoff: using the **most granular data available where it matters most**, while maintaining consistency and reliability for other cost categories.

## Analytical Approach

### Housing Cost Modeling
City-level housing prices were used to estimate monthly housing costs for each city. Housing was intentionally modeled at the city level because it is typically the **largest and most variable household expense**, and often the primary driver of affordability differences within the same state.

---

### Living Wage Construction
State-level cost structures from the MIT Living Wage Calculator were combined with city-level housing estimates to produce a baseline “living wage” for each city.

Baseline living wages were calculated for **eight household structures**, including:
- One-adult households with zero to three children
- Two-adult households with zero to three children

These figures represent **essential living costs only**, not discretionary spending.

---

### Data Preparation & Quality Control
- Initial raw data supported approximately **14,000 cities**
- Through restructuring, re-keying, and targeted data cleaning, coverage was expanded to **~20,000 cities**
- Remaining cities were excluded due to unresolved geocoding or data inconsistencies
- Excel was used extensively to process, validate, and combine nearly **200,000 individual data points**

Data exclusions were treated as known limitations rather than silently ignored.

---

## Affordability Framework & Assumptions
The baseline living-wage estimates do **not** include:
- Savings contributions
- Debt repayment
- Retirement funding
- Discretionary spending (travel, entertainment, etc.)

To translate baseline costs into a more realistic affordability assessment, income was evaluated using **percentage buffers above the calculated living wage**:

- **Less than 10% above baseline**: Unaffordable  
- **10–20% above baseline**: Somewhat Affordable  
- **20–30% above baseline**: Affordable  
- **More than 30% above baseline**: Very Affordable  

These thresholds were chosen to approximate increasing levels of financial flexibility beyond subsistence-level expenses. A 20–30% margin above baseline costs aligns with common household budget allocations for savings, debt servicing, and discretionary spending, while remaining conservative enough to avoid overstating affordability.

## Decision Support & Outputs
The final output is an **interactive Tableau map** designed to support comparison and exploration.

Users can:
- Enter net household income
- Select one of eight household structures
- Instantly view affordability classifications for cities across the U.S.

Cities are dynamically categorized into four affordability tiers, allowing users to quickly identify regions that align with their financial situation. The tool is intended to support **decision-making and exploration**, not to provide prescriptive financial advice.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**
  - Data collection, restructuring, cleaning, and validation
  - Formula-driven processing to efficiently manage large datasets

- **Tableau**
  - Interactive parameters and calculated fields
  - Geographic visualization focused on usability and clarity

---

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and structured city-level affordability dataset (~26,000 cities)
- Interactive Tableau affordability map
- Static preview images for portfolio documentation

---

## Limitations & Future Enhancements
- Housing costs are estimated and do not reflect individual mortgage terms or rental markets
- Local taxes and insurance costs are approximated at the state level
- Future iterations could incorporate:
  - Rental market data
  - Metro-level adjustments
  - Scenario analysis for interest rates or housing types
